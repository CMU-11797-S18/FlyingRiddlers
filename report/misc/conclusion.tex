\label{future}
In this paper, we present a framework for tackling both ideal and exact answer type questions and obtain state of the art results on the ideal answer type questions on the BioASQ dataset. In our framework for ideal answers, we aimed at improving the Information Retrieval component of the extractive summarization. Although this improved ROUGE scores considerably, the human readability aspect of the generated summary answer is not improved to a great extent. We are presently working on using effective abstractive summarization based approaches like Pointer Generator Networks \cite{PGC} and Reinforcement Learning based abstractive summarization techniques \cite{salesforce} to try and improve the human readability aspect of our ideal answers. We aim to continue our research in this direction to adapt these networks to get a good balance between ROUGE score and human readability.
